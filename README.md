Data Analysis of publicly available Iowa alcohol sale data set

1. Sales Distribution across different liquor Category
2. Sales Distribution across different Vendor Category
3. Sales distribution across different Items
4. Sales distribution across Weekday vs Weekends

The star schema design looks like below:
